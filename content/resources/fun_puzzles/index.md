## Barfi Packing

Consider Kaju Barfis in shape of rhombus of side length 1 completely filling a regular hexagonal box of side length \\(n\\). It is easy to see that you can indeed tile it. You can place it with three possible orientations as shown in the figure below.

![Barfi](barfi.webp?=1x)

Prove the following:

> $$ \textit{In any packing, there are an equal number of Kaju Barfis with each orientation.} $$

## Race To 15

Consider the following two-player game:

> Two players, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), choose numbers from 1 to 9 one after the other. The numbers aren’t available for future use once picked. If at any time the sum of three numbers chosen by one of them adds up to 15 then that player wins.

Who has the winning strategy?

## Guess the Sign

Can you guess the sign of the \\(n^{\text{th}}\\) term of the expression?

$$
\prod_{i=1}^\infty (1-a_i) = 1 - a_1 - a_2 + a_1a_2 - a_3 + a_3a_1 + a_3a_2 - a_3a_1a_2 - \dots
$$
