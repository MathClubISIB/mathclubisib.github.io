{{< katex >}}

In the "What Is...?" seminar, speakers will take up a topic and try to elaborate on what it entails, while assuming minimal to no prerequisites. Each presentation will follow a 40+10 format, allowing for a 40-minute talk followed by a 10-minute discussion. The proceedings of the seminar will be made available by 15th April, that is, a week after the seminar ends.

## WI01: What Is ?(x)?

- **Speaker:** Aaratrick Basu (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** We introduce the function $?(x)$ defined by Minkowski in 1904, and studied quite well since. It is a continuous function on $\[0,1\]$ which has very interesting properties relating to dynamical systems, number theory, integral transforms, and is a rich object as a function itself via analysis of continued fractions and convergents. We give a whirlwind tour of some of these aspects, presenting only the main definitions and results. No prerequisites beyond first-year knowledge of analysis and algebra will be assumed formally, but we do demand accepting certain technical facts on faith.

## WI02: What Is Graphon?

- **Speaker:** Bikram Halder (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** Graphons, short for graph functions, are limiting objects of large finite graphs with respect to the cut-metric, which provides a powerful analytic framework for analyzing large graphs. In this talk, we will introduce graphons, motivate them, discuss how they complete the space of finite graphs. We will look at some results that connect the the finite world of graphs with the continuous world of graphons.

## WI03: What Is Shannon Entropy?

- **Speaker:** Hrishik Koley (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** Entropy is a concept that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder. The concept of information entropy was introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper "[A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf)". It gives us an idea of the information content of the process. We will introduce Shannon entropy as a fundamental limit for how much we can compress a source, without risking distortion or loss. We will be introducing this concept of Shannon entropy and look at it's various characterizations. If time permits, we may also take a look at Alfred Renyi's extension of Shannon entropy, famously known as, the Renyi entropy.

## WI06: What Is Mixing Time?

- **Speaker:** Deepta Basak (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** [TBU]
- **Video:** [TBU]
- **Date and Time:** Friday, 22nd March 2024, 9:00pm-10:00pm
- **Venue:** 2nd Floor Auditorium, Academic Building

## WI07: What Is Coupling?

- **Speaker:** Saraswata Sensarma (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** In this talk, we give brief introduction to the notion of coupling of probability measures. Coupling is an extremely versatile tool, which finds applications in almost all facets of probability theory. In the first half of the talk, we will explore its use in studying mixing in finite Markov chains. In the second half, we introduce the notion of stochastic domination and analyze it through the lens of coupling. We then extend this notion to posets, which naturally leads us to correlation inequalities like Harris' inequality and FKG inequality. These find extensive applications in percolation theory and the Ising model, and the random cluster model in general.

## WI08: What Is Cut-Off?

- **Speaker:** Sanchayan Bhowal (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** I will introduce the cutoff phenomenon in Markov Chains. I will discuss some examples where this is observed like random walk in hypercube and card shuffling. Finally I'll discuss the characterization of cutoff under some special cases like birth death chains. We will also look into famous examples by Aldous and Pak where the characterization falls short.

## WI09: What Is Graph Cohomology?

- **Speaker:** Prognadipto Majumdar (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** We'll define models of graph complexes and explore basic topological properties of graphs. We'll move on to an application of a certain model of graph cohomolgy which directly gives us the Chromatic Polynomial. If time permits , we may look at some connections to TQFTs.

## WI12: What Is Poincaré Recurrence Theorem?

- **Speaker:** Devansh Kamra (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** Poincare's Recurrence Theorem is a celebrated result in Ergodic Theory, which states that a dynamical system under certain constraints is bound to return arbitrarily close to its initial stage after a finite amount of time. This result has found widespread applications in the study of dynamical systems. We would be discussing this result from a measure-theoretic viewpoint, building upon the necessary notions before developing a neat proof of the theorem, along with some applications.
