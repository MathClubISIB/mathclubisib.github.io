## ProbCGCV 2024: Discussion Meeting on Probability, Convex Geometry and Complex Variables

The research themes of the meeting will be random analytic functions (in one and several variables), real and complex methods in convex geometry and random polytopes. The emphasis will be on the interplay between probability, convex geometry and complex analysis. Individually, these are thriving subjects within India and globally but increasingly there are many questions arising at the intersection of these subjects. The meeting aims to gather researchers working at the interface of probability, convex geomety and complex variables so as to keep abreast of latest developments in these three related disciplines. We hope the meeting will encourage joint collaborative research and discussions amongst such researchers on a regular basis.

- **Dates:** 4th - 9th January, 2024
- **Venue:** TIFR-CAM, Bengaluru
