## ProbCGCV 2024: Discussion Meeting on Probability, Convex Geometry and Complex Variables

The research themes of the meeting will be random analytic functions (in one and several variables), real and complex methods in convex geometry and random polytopes. The emphasis will be on the interplay between probability, convex geometry and complex analysis. Individually, these are thriving subjects within India and globally but increasingly there are many questions arising at the intersection of these subjects. The meeting aims to gather researchers working at the interface of probability, convex geomety and complex variables so as to keep abreast of latest developments in these three related disciplines.

## International Colloquium on Randomness, Geometry, and Dynamics

The International Colloquium (IC) is the flagship conference of the School of Mathematics at TIFR Mumbai, organized once every four years. This year it is being jointly organized by TIFR Mumbai and IISER Pune.  
The theme for IC 2024 is probability, geometric group theory and dynamics. Recent years have seen spectacular progress in these areas. Much of this progress has taken place at their interface, and connections between these fields have thrived. The IC 2024 will bring together experts from these research areas and cover topics including probability, hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, holomorphic dynamics, and homogeneous dynamics.
