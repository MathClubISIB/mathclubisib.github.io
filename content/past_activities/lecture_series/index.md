## LS221: Topological Groups and Their Representations

Number of Talks: 7

**Target:** In the following talks, we will discuss the representation theory of topological groups, building from the familiar theory for finite groups. We begin by introducing representations of finite groups and character theory for finite groups. We then look at topological groups and their elementary properties, also looking at some of their elementary representations. Following this, the Haar measure will be introduced along with the existence and uniqueness of the Invariant Haar Mean on compact groups. We then proceed to look at amenable groups, and more specifically compact groups, and study their representations using the Haar mean, to obtain familiar results, such as those in the theory of finite groups. We finally proceed to discuss the Peter-Weyl Theorems.

## LS212: Conjugacy Classes and Irreducible Representations of a Group

Number of Talks: 2

- **Abstracts:**
  - **Talk 1:** In this talk, we introduce some concepts from the representation theory of finite groups. Our goal ll be to have a foundation upon which we can build the proof of Burnside's result about the conjugacy classes of a finite group in the next talk. We'll briefly discuss unitary and irreducible representations, morphisms and some basics of character theory. Time permitting, we will also discuss the orthogonality relations.  
    **Date and Time:** Saturday, 27th March 2021, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm
  - **Talk 2:** In this talk, we will develop the theory of characters further and work with real characters to find nstraints on the number of conjugacy classes of groups with odd order. Specifically, we will understand two theorems credited to Burnside which state that the number of real irreducible characters and real conjugacy classes of a group are equal, and that the number of conjugacy classes in the case of a group with odd order is congruent to the order modulo 16.  
    **Date and Time:** Sunday, 28th March 2021, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm

On the way, if time permits, we talk in varying degrees of informality about Cayley graphs and how to recognize them, Stallings' theorem on ends of groups, Property T, Bruhat-Tits trees, and expander graphs.

## LS191: The Extension Problem & Cohomology of Groups

Number of Talks: 2

- **Abstract:** One of the most natural ways to understand a group is to “break it down” to smaller groups which are easier to understand. The problem then translates to understanding how these smaller “stratum groups” interact, or glue together, in the original group. This is known as ‘the extension problem’. We will try to understand the geometry of the basic examples of group extensions we understand: semi-direct products, in which case this “gluing recipe” is relatively simple. We will try to understand precisely when a group can be written as a semidirect product of two smaller groups, and in the process introduce and motivate “cohomology theory”, an idea which seems to have left it’s trace on most corners of twentieth century mathematics.
- **Speaker:** Balarka Sen (B. Math, 2021)
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic Group Theory.
- **Date and Time:** 26th January (Saturday) & 27th January (Sunday) 2019, 3:15 PM.

## LS184: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing

Number of Talks: 2

- **Abstract:** Natural Language Processing is a recent topic which has emerged in the past decade. Natural Language Processing, abbreviated as NLP, is the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and hence helps machines “read” text by simulating the human ability to understand language. In these lectures we shall explore the architecture behind the machine learning algorithms used to train a model for processing human language. In the first lecture we will discuss about the older versions used for NLP like Skip-Gram and Bag-of-Words. In the second lecture we will see how the older techniques pave way for advanced tools like GloVe to process language.
- **Speaker:** Soumyabrata Kundu (B. Math, 2020)
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic Linear Algebra
- **Date and Time:** 1st September (Saturday), & 2nd September (Sunday), 2018 at 3 PM

## LS183: Classification of Root System

Number of Talks: 2

- **Abstract:** Root system is an algebraic combinatoric object which has always been in the hindsight of Lie Theory. It is widely recognized as a method to classify semi-simple Lie Algebras and Coxeter and reflection groups, as every semi-simple Lie algebra induces a root system. The main objects besides the root system in Euclidean spaces, are Weyl groups, Weyl chambers, and bases associated with the root system. In the first lecture I am going to give proof of their relation which induces a construction of Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for irreducible root systems, after that it is a completely combinatoric argument which is going to classify the root systems; this would be discussed in the second lecture.
- **Speaker:** Sumit Kumar Singh (B. Math, 2020)
- **Pre-requisites:**
  - Basic Linear Algebra
  - Basic Group Theory (knowledge of group actions will be sufficient)

**Date and Time:** 25th August (Friday) & 26th August (Saturday), 2018 at 3 PM

## LS182: Intuitive Introduction to Lie Groups

Number of Talks: 2

- **Abstract:** We will explore the basic properties of Lie Groups. The key idea is to study properties of certain groups by “localizing” them (here, the group we are interested in is the Lie Group and we localize them by associating Lie Algebra of the group). Our prototypical examples are (topologically) closed subgroups of . Then we will classify all the connected commutative Lie Groups. One of the important theorems in the beginning of this vast theory is Cartan’s theorem, which says that any closed subgroup of a Lie Group is also a Lie Group. If time permits, I will say a few words about group actions on manifolds.

  - Basic Multivariate Analysis
  - Some knowledge of manifolds will definitely help

## LS181: Random Walks

Number of talks: 2

- **Abstract:** The concepts of random walks are trending these days. Researchers from diverse fields are trying to incorporate the structure of a random walk in their own area of research. We will try to understand random walks on integer lattices. We will also look at random walks on any connected graph. We will briefly look at Markov chains and try to understand the concepts of transient and recurrent states. We will also look at various examples of Markov Chains such as the Gambler’s Ruin problem and the Ehrenfest Model of diffusion. We will then talk about the Galton-Watson process which is a branching process. Recently one of my friends (Dwaipayan Basu of St. Xaviers Kolkata, department of microbiology) and I tried to model cancer using the Galton-Watson model. If time permits we will look at Branching Random walks (Prof. Parthanil Roy recently published a paper on that topic). If even further time is permitted I will talk about my ongoing work with my friend, about explaining protein folding using Markov Chains.
- **Speaker:** Suvadip Sana (B. Math, 2019)
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic Probability theory (mostly basics of conditional probability).
- **Further Note:** Main takeaway from this talk would be the idea of Random Walks and Markov Chains. Without any pre-requisites you can still get the ideas involved. As such, this talk is accessible to all.
- **Date and Time:** 11th August (Friday) & 12th August (Saturday), 2018 at 3 PM
