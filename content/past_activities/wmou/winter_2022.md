### Category Theory

Category theory originally arose as methods of formalising certain facts that hold for entire classes of mathematical structures, so as to make life easier and prove theorems at once for a large class of objects. In the last 50 or so years, it has however become a very diverse and useful branch of mathematics unto itself. We plan to have a brisk walk through the basic areas of category theory as well as look at how such abstractions actually help in solving very relevant problems in real life.

### Galois Theory

In the nineteenth century, two very young mathematicians, Neils Abel and Evariste Galois, answered a question about which the mathematical world had been curious for centuries. It is a question about the central activity of algebra, solving equations, particularly the question: Is there a formula for solving fifth degree polynomial equations? In this reading project, we will provide a modernized approach towards solving this question and discover the many uses of this approach and how it plays a central role in Algebra.

### Generating Functions

Generating functions are a useful tool which have a wide range of applicability. They can be used to find recurrence relations, sometimes even the exact form of a sequence. They can be used to get asymptotic formulae for the sequence when the exact form is too difficult to calculate, as in the case of The Prime number Theorem. Generating functions can also be used to calculate averages and other statistical properties of a sequence. This winter, we’ll try and learn some of these applications of Generating functions.

### Markov Chain and Mixing Time

The study of Markov Chains is a lively and central part of modern probability theory. It has ties to several other mathematical areas as well, such as Algebraic Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Representation Theory to name a few. In this group reading project, we are going to introduce Markov Chains and look at a lot of classical (and useful) examples. Time permitting, we will look at Card Shuffling chains, which are an interpretation of Random Walks on the Symmetric Group.

- **Pre-Requisites:**
    - A first course in Probability Theory and Linear Algebra will be sufficient.
- **Primary Reference:**
    - Markov Chains and Mixing Times by Levin, Peres, Wilmer
- **Group Leader(s):**
    - Deepta Basak (B2)
    - Saraswata Sensarma (B2)
- **Brief Sketch of Project:**
    - Using the classical examples of Gambler’s Ruin and The Coupon Collector’s Problem, we will introduce the idea of a Finite Markov Chain. We shall talk about certain characteristics of a Markov Chain like Irreducibility, Aperiodicity and Time Reversibility.
    - Next, we shall talk about the existence and uniqueness of the Stationary Distribution of a Markov Chain.
    - Next, we proceed to look at some further examples of Markov Chains that come up throughout probability and statistics.
    - A crucial result that we shall discuss at this point is that under some mild conditions, Markov Chains do, infact, converge to their Stationary Distributions. We define total variation distance and mixing time, the key tools for quantifying that convergence.
    -  If there is time, we might look at some more applications like Card Shuffling.

    - We will talk about the Linearity of Expectation and show its use as a powerful tool in proving some results in Graph Theory and several other topics.

### Topology and Topological Groups

Topology arises in most of the field of mathematics quite naturally, and the study of topological spaces is a prime task in mathematics. Topology attempts to generalize geometry to apply it to a vast number of settings. This is going to a primary introduction to topology and we will also see what happens when we add more structure to the space such as topological groups. If time permits we will give a brief motivation for Algebraic Topology.

- **Primary Reference:**
    - Topology by Klaus Janich.
    - Introduction to Topological Manifolds by John Lee.
    - Topology by James Munkres
- **Group Leader(s):**
    - Soumya Dasgupta (B2)
    - Trishan Mondal (B2)
- **Brief Sketch of Project:**
    - We will start off with introduction to topological spaces, and discuss about bases, and continuous function and homeomorphisms on topological spaces.
    - We will also need some tools from group theory, and give a brief idea about matrix groups, which we will need later when we come to Topological groups.
    - Next task would be to cover important topics such as connectedness, path-connectedness and compactness.
    - We will discuss about ways to construct new topological spaces from existing spaces (quotient topology, connected sums, adjunction).
    - Finally we will discuss about topological groups, and see how the matrix groups are just geometric objects in disguise.
    - If time permits we will give a motivation for Algebraic Topology.
