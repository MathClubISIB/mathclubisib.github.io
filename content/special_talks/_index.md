## ST2409: A Glimpse into Geometric Group Theory: Folding and the Ping-Pong

- **Speaker:** Rinkiny Ghatak (B.Math, 3rd year)
- **Abstract:** Geometric group theory looks at groups through the geometric objects that they act on (graphs, topological spaces, manifolds, etc.), and the geometric properties of those objects help us understand algebraic properties of the group. In the first half of the talk, I will talk about how we can "fold" graphs to study subgroups of free groups, which is otherwise a difficult task with pure algebraic tools. In the second half, we will see the ping-pong lemma, where we identify free groups by seeing if they "play ping-pong" or not. We will see a very nice application in the study of the subgroups of \\(PSL(2,\mathbb{C})\\) by looking at their action on the Riemann sphere.
- **Prerequisites:** Basic notions of group theory would help. Having some knowledge of algebraic topology will help see more connections, but it is not at all necessary.

## ST2408: Tribone Tilings: Honeycombs to Benzels

- **Speaker:** Hrishik Koley (B. Math, 3rd year)
- **Abstract:** Tilings have been a very interesting field of algebraic combinatorics, since it's dawn, and yet has a plethora of unanswered questions, partly owing to the fact that new shapes and new tiles never cease to arise and being considered. From such wide classes of shapes and tiles, Conway and Lagarias considered and showed that certain roughly triangular regions in the hexagonal grid or honeycombs cannot be tiled by shapes Thurston later dubbed tribones. However, in 2021, Propp introduced a two-parameter family of roughly hexagonal regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels and showed that a tiling by tribones exists under certain constraints on these parameters.
- **Pre-requisites:** Some knowledge of graph theory, group theory, and basic topology might help, but I would anyways introduce all the needed concepts.

## ST2403: An Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem

- **Speaker:** Korou Khundrakpam (B. Math, 2nd year)
- **Abstract:** The distribution of prime numbers, particularly the Prime Number Theorem, has fascinated mathematicians for centuries, with key milestones marked by advances made by notable mathematicians throughout the course of history. In this talk, we will explore Chebyshev’s contributions to the problem, mainly his work that laid the foundation for estimating the density of prime numbers. We will then delve into the elegance and significance of Selberg’s "elementary" proof of the Prime Number Theorem, highlighting how it revolutionized our understanding of the asymptotic behavior of primes. But everything is a blank slate. Do you all notice that. But yet so lush green. Interesting, huh!?! A combination of green and blank. By connecting these pivotal results, we will gain insight into how modern analytic and elementary techniques contribute to unraveling the mysteries of prime number distribution.
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic knowledge of Number Theory.
- **Notes:** [TBU]
- **Video:** [TBU]
- **Date and Time:** Saturday, 21st September 2024, 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM
- **Venue:** G-26 Classroom, Academic Building

## ST2311: Analytic Continuation of the Riemann Zeta Function and the Prime Number Theorem

- **Speaker:** Amit Kumar Basistha (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** The Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is a fundamental result in number theory that describes the distribution of prime numbers. The PNT has been studied extensively and has numerous proofs, many involving Complex Analysis and the behavior of the Riemann Zeta function. The main goal of this talk will be to present a proof of the theorem. While doing so we will also explore the beautiful world of analytic continuation of functions in the complex plane, particularly of the Gamma and Zeta function. We will also discuss the growth and behavior of the Zeta function near the line \\(\textsf{Re}(s)=1\\).Through the talk we will try to convey the idea how two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics: Number Theory which is discrete at its heart and Complex Analysis can come together to give such powerful results.

## ST2003: Quiver Representations and Gabriel's Theorem

- **Speaker:** Supravat Sarkar (M. Math, 2021)
- **Abstract:** Quiver representations is a very important topic in representation theory. The problem of classifying representation of certain quivers vastly generalizes the problem of classifying linear transformation in linear algebra. Gabriel's theorem classifies representations of certain quivers, called 'finite type' quivers, which are the quivers having only finitely many indecomposable representations. Interestingly, the classification is given by the positive roots of a root system. A root system is a combinatorial object arising unexpectedly in many seeming unrelated areas of representation theory. We shall talk about quiver representations, introduce root systems and finally prove one direction of Gabriel's theorem.
- **Pre-requisites:** I shall define everything, but it would be very helpful to have a look at root system and Weyl group.
- **Date and time:** Saturday, 8th February 2020, 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Venue:** G-26 Classroom, Academic Building
