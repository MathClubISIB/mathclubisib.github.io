## Introduction to Probabilistic Methods

Probabilistic Methods was a branch mastered by Paul Erdős. He used to often refer to it as the subject that makes proofs beautiful and elegant or, to state it in his terms, proofs from "The Book". The methods not only provides elegant existence proofs but also quantitative bounds, often improving upon what is achievable through purely constructive arguments. Roughly speaking, the method works as follows: You are trying to prove that a structure with certain desired properties exists, one defines an appropriate probability space of structures and then shows that the desired properties hold in this space with positive probability. We would initially go through Asymptotics, which will be helpful throughout the course. Mostly, this is a subject that helps you to connect every existing branch of Mathematics to Probability.

## Exploring Random Walks

The beauty of random walks is that it is deceptively simple to set up, but beneath lies and exciting world of surprising applications and magnificent structures. Motivating it by a couple of simple examples, we would at first try to unravel some of its magnificent properties, then would establish its relation with electrical networks. After that we would end the session either by explicitly constructing Brownian motion from random walks, or by generalizing the concept of random walks to the model of random polymers.

## Tilings: Algebraic & Probabilistic Expedition

We will introduce the mathematics of tilings of the plane and higher dimensional shapes from both an algebraic and a probabilistic perspective. Tilings takes an interesting question that serves as a perfect meeting ground for geometry, group theory, combinatorics, representation theory, and probability. On the algebraic side, we study how symmetric groups classify periodic tilings and explore substitution tilings such as the Penrose tiling. On the probabilistic side, we investigate random tilings, domino models, and the striking emergence of global order from local randomness, such as the arctic circle phenomenon. Expect to start off by seeing a lot of beautiful structures, and slowly delve into it’s connections to algebra, probability, and, if time permits, topology.

## Computing & Logic

Functional programming is a paradigm that is rising in importance in contemporary times. Modern functional programming has a history deeply linked with that of mathematical logic, and provides a powerful alternative to the imperative approach. In this project, we will explore ways of thinking about abstractions in computer science, particularly from this functional point of view. We shall cover topics in propositional logic, lambda calculus, type theory and general functional programming.

## Analytic Number Theory

Analytic number theory investigates the distribution of prime numbers through methods drawn from analysis. The subject demonstrates how classical questions in number theory can be approached using powerful analytic techniques, often leading to striking and unexpected results. This course provides an introduction to some of the central ideas and results in the field, while also pointing toward deeper connections such as those surrounding the Riemann Hypothesis. The course is designed to balance rigor with accessibility, introducing fundamental analytic methods in number theory to students with prior exposure to elementary number theory and real analysis.
