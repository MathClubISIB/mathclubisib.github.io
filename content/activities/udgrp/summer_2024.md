This is the home page of the UDGRP Summer 2024 organised by the [Math Club](/). The projects start from Saturday, 15<sup>th</sup> May, 2024. The topic being considered this time are presented below.

## Stability Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations

In this UDGRP, We will going to discover some specific topic related ODE from analysis view point rather than boring computational view point. The topic is Stability Analysis of ODEs. We will recall some basic stuff as a prerequisite. Then we will introduce Linear systems. After covering the the fundamental theorem for Linear System we will learn about basic Stability theory of both Linear homogeneous and Linear non homogeneous systems. We introduce the flow defined by a differential equation. We will do the Stable Manifold theorem.
We will restrict our discussion inside the local theory of non linear systems. Students who are familiar with Basic linear algebra and real analysis who want to learn theory of ODE from analysis view point will be benefited. The most of the theory will be built during the programme. If time permits we will see some of itâ€™s practical application.
