This is the home page of the UDGRP Winter 2024 organised by the [Math Club](/). The projects start from Monday, 25<sup>th</sup> November, 2024. The topics being considered this time are presented below.

## Enumerative Combinatorics

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of discrete objects and their arrangements. It deals with counting, enumerating, and analyzing configurations of objects that can be distinct or identical, finite or infinite, and arranged in various ways. Over the years as this field of mathematics has matured it has become exceedingly harder to provide purely combinatorial arguments for the questions that continue to arise. Thus, there has been a need to introduce the interplay of combinatorics with various methods ranging from algebraic to analytic to probabilistic. In this UDGRP, we will mainly be focusing on the algebraic and geometric methods, and at times, may call upon some probabilistic methods, if necessary.

    - Lattice Path Enumeration
    - Integer Partitions and Symmetric Functions
    - Catalan Numbers, Dyck Paths, and q,t-analogues

## Geometric Group Theory

Geometric group theory is all about looking at groups through the geometric objects they act on - like graphs, topological spaces, manifolds. The geometric properties of those objects help us understand algebraic properties of the group. We use group actions on various sets in order to gather some useful information about the groups. We will start by introducing Cayley graphs and proving some theorems. Then we will try to develop some machinery and prove that any group that acts freely on a tree is a free group. From there, we will go towards the proof of Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which says that any subgroup of a free group is free. We will also introduce hyperbolic plane and explore group actions on it. If time permits, we will touch on solvable groups and prove the tits alternative.
