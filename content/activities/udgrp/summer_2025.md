{{< lead >}} UDGRP Winter 2024 HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED. FIND BELOW THE TOPICS COVERED IN EACH GROUP.{{< /lead >}}

Due to UDGRP Summer 2025 being attended by students from various universities of India so, we are not keeping track of the people who completed each reading project.

This is the home page of the UDGRP Summer 2025 co-organised by the [Math Club, ISI Bangalore](/) and [Math Club, ISI Kolkata](https://mathclubisik.github.io/). It is open for students from all universities in India. The projects start from Monday, 19<sup>th</sup> May, 2025. The topics being considered this time are presented below.

## An Invitation to High Dimensional Probability

High Dimensional Probability (HDP) is a branch of probability which deals with large dimensional random vectors. The techniques are well suited for the study of models with a large number of random inputs which are roughly independent - so that the space of parameters is high dimensional. Such models arise quite frequently in data science, randomized algorithms, signal processing, and quantum information theory.

&nbsp; &nbsp; There are four essential themes of high dimensional probability: Concentration, Suprema, Universality and Phase transitions. In this project, we wish to explore the first and second themes in considerable detail, while touching upon the latter two briefly.

## Random Walk on Graphs

This summer reading course introduces the theory of random walks on graphs — a special class of Markov chains — and explores its powerful connections and applications. Starting with the basic definition of a random walk on a graph, we will see how key questions (e.g., expected return times) can be answered elegantly by interpreting graphs as electrical networks. This perspective leads to simple, intuitive methods for computing hitting probabilities and resistances.

&nbsp; &nbsp; By the end of the course, participants will understand both the probabilistic and analytic techniques behind random walks, and see how these tools solve a wide range of problems in combinatorics, probability, and network theory.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: Basic tools like moment methods, bounded difference inequalities will be covered by Saraswata in his High Dimensional Probability course.

## Representation Theory & Symmetric Functions

Symmetry is everywhere -- from the shapes of molecules to the roots of equations. But how do we quantify symmetry mathematically? This question is answered by \textbf{representation theory}, where abstract groups like permutations and rotations are transformed into concrete matrices and combinatorial objects. Vector spaces and matrices, having a lot of structure, are exploited to study groups by using “representations”.
&nbsp; &nbsp; We will emphasize on studying the representation theory of the symmetric group, where we will prove that its irreducible representations are in bijection with integer partitions and construct them explicitly via Specht modules.
&nbsp; &nbsp; We will also explore how the representation-theoretic perspective leads naturally to symmetric functions -- which plays a key role in modern combinatorics. We will finally go on to examine combinatorial manifestations through the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence and Schur functions.

## Galois Theory

Galois theory as the name suggests was introduced by Galois for studying roots of a polynomial. The main problem was to characterize polynomial equations that are solvable by radicals. The Galois theory which was developed by Galois is quite different from what we study now, it's the works of Emil Artin which will be our main focus. We will need a basic understanding of Group Theory, Rings and Modules, though all these topics that may sound unfamiliar are actually quite intuitive. In fact one can easily get a hold of prerequisites while reading field theory, which is the start of Galois Theory. We definitely look at the Fundamental Theorem of Galois theory, which gives bijection between intermediate field extensions $k \subseteq L \subseteq K$ and subgroups of the Galois group of the field extensions $K$ over $k$, whenever the extension is a finite Galois extension. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory will resolve Galois' dream, we will give a precise characterization of polynomials that are solvable by radicals. Other applications include the most elementary proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that actually uses algebra. But Galois theory is not just about all these, it has deep connections with other fields of mathematics such as covering spaces. There are also other aspects that one can look at such as Galois theory for infinite algebraic extensions or one can also look at more practical examples coming from Algebraic Geometry where the field extensions are not necessarily algebraic.

## Analytic Number Theory

The works of Euler, Dirichlet and Riemann revolutionised the study of number theory by using relatively modern analysis to study the millenniums old subject, and gave rise to what is known today as analytic number theory. The subject has the speciality that though there are many questions that can be explained to a complete layman, the solutions require some of the most sophisticated mathematical structures.

&nbsp; &nbsp; This reading course will be the first steps in learning the vast subject, and we would see some of the beautiful results, while stating the present-day best known result in related topic.
