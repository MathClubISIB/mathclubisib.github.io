## SL2302: The Lovász Local Lemma

- **Speaker:** Prof. Jaikumar Radhakrishnan (ICTS-TIFR, Bengaluru & TIFR, Mumbai)
- **Abstract:** The local lemma of Lovász provides sufficient conditions to show that the probability of a union of events is strictly less than 1. It forms the basis for several probabilistic existence arguments in discrete mathematics. We will present the lemma and its proofs, and also some of its applications.
- **Notes:** Aavilable [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lf3ckc6S5RprbeMAOABN75ySRGUijpc7/view?usp=drive_link).

- **Date and time:** Saturday, 28th October 2023, 11:00 am - 1:00 pm
- **Place:** 2nd Floor Auditorium, Academic Building

## SL2301: Strong unique continuation for second order elliptic operators

- **Speaker:** Prof. Agnid Banerjee (TIFR-CAM, Bengaluru)
- **Abstract:** The lecture will focus on a very classical subject: when do the zeros of a solution to a PDE spread?
  - It will start with a brief historic overview, and
  - Then illustrate the two technologies presently available to mankind for addressing the strong unique continuation for \\(-\Delta + V\\)
