## SL2401: Gram matrices: connecting GPS triangulation, Euclidean metric embeddings, and Heron's formula

- **Speaker:** Prof. Apoorva Khare (IISc, Bangalore)
- **Abstract:** Given a finite metric space, when is it flat (i.e., embeds in a Euclidean space)? When is it spherical? What is the mathematics behind GPS? As we will prove in the talk, the answers to all of these questions involve only one idea: Gram matrices. Like Bond and Bourne, these too have numerous aliases: covariance matrices, positive semidefinite matrices, and modified Cayley-Menger matrices. After discussing these aliases and questions, we end with another application: the 2000-year-old formula of Heron, and its generalization to 2024-dimensional triangles (or n-dimensional simplices).
