## SL1801: Dimension, Entropy, Large deviations.

- **Speaker:** Prof. Manjunath Krishnapur (IISc Bangalore)
- **Abstract:** We introduce the notion of Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension, which may be thought of as ways to measure the size of a metric space. This generalizes the usual notion of dimension of a vector space or of a manifold, and can take fractional values. For example, the standard middle-thirds Cantor set has dimension \\(\log\_{3}{2}\\). We then show how it arises in a natural question of computing probabilities of unlikely events in probability. Entropy is a related concept lurking in the background. We shall mention it, but not make it any less confusing than it usually is.
- **Pre-requisites:** The talk should be accessible to those who know metric spaces and basic probability.
- **Date and Time:** Sunday, 28th October 2018, 3:00pm - 5:00pm
- **Place:** 2nd Floor Auditorium, Academic Building
