## EP1802: Introduction to Hardy Spaces

- **Speaker:** Dr. Muthukumar P. (Ph.D, 2019, ISI Chennai)
- **Abstract:** We will start our discussion with some interplay between complex analysis and functional analysis. I will provide a very simple proof of "Cauchy Integral Formula" for analytic functions on closed unit disk, using the famous "Riesz Representation Theorem" from functional analysis. Then, we will move to introduction of Hardy spaces and its basic properties.
- **Pre-requisites:** Elementary complex analysis and elementary functional analysis.
- **Date and Time:** Saturday, 3rd November 2018, 3:00 PM
- **Venue:** G-26 Classroom, Academic Building

## EP1801: Algebraic Coding Theory

- **Speaker:** Shyambhu Mukherjee (B. Math, 2019)
- **Abstract:** Communication channels and needs of coding -- block codes, linear and non-linear, basic ideas-- linear block codes, generator, parity check matrix, encoding decoding syndrome -- main coding theory problem -- explanation of main coding problem, discussion of basic bounds and mention of latest bounds found. If time is left, asymptotic bounds will be discussed here, followed by chapter on cyclic codes.
