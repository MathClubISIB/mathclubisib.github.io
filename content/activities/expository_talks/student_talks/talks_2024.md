## EP2402: Introduction to Non-Commutative Spaces

- **Speaker:** Saqib Mushtaq Shah (M. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** We will first demonstrate that commutative (unital) C*-algebras are dual to compact Hausdorff spaces through the Gelfand representation. Drawing inspiration from the commutative case, we attempt to construct duals (referred to as noncommutative spaces) of noncommutative C*-algebras using various methods of generalization. We prove some basic properties and will establish the relationship between these noncommutative spaces.

## EP2401: A Gist of Optimal Transport

- **Speaker:** Malav Dhaval Doshi (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** In this talk we will explore the roots of optimal transport. Initiating with Monge formation we will delve into the more generalized formation of the optimal transport problem given by Kantorivich. We would then look into the dual formation of the both and an introduction to Legendre Transforms. The core focus of this talk would be to prove the result that rather than optimizing the dual on every pair of functions it suffices to optimize it over the convex pairs of the function. Though it assumes very few things but still it is a cornerstone result of the topic!!
