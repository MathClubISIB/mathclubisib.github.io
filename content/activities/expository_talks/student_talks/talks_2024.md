## EP2408: Tribone Tilings: Honeycombs to Benzels

- **Speaker:** Hrishik Koley (B. Math, 3rd year)
- **Abstract:** Tilings have been a very interesting field of algebraic combinatorics, since it's dawn, and yet has a plethora of unanswered questions, partly owing to the fact that new shapes and new tiles never cease to arise and being considered. From such wide classes of shapes and tiles, Conway and Lagarias considered and showed that certain roughly triangular regions in the hexagonal grid or honeycombs cannot be tiled by shapes Thurston later dubbed tribones. However, in 2021, Propp introduced a two-parameter family of roughly hexagonal regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels and showed that a tiling by tribones exists under certain constraints on these parameters.
- **Pre-requisites:** Some knowledge of graph theory might help, but I would anyways introduce all the needed concepts.

- **Date and Time:** Saturday, 24th August 2024, 11:30 AM - 01:00 PM
- **Venue:** 2nd Floor Auditorium, Academic Building

## EP2407: Homological Methods in Number Theory

- **Speaker:** Amit Kumar Basistha (B. Math, 3rd year)
- **Abstract:** The application of Homological Methods in Algebraic Number Theory, particularly in Class Field Theory, gained popularity around the 1950s and has propelled enormous advancement in the subject. In this talk, I will introduce some notions of Group Cohomology and how they are applicable in Number Theory. In particular, I will introduce the notion of 'Abstract Class Formation' and define the reciprocity isomorphism and its functorial properties. Finally I will present a nice characterization of the Norm Groups of a Local Field.
- **Pre-requisites:** Knowledge of Abstract Algebra and some point set topology will be assumed. Further the content of the talk on Homological Algebra by Sankha Subhra Chakraborty will be assumed.

## EP2406: Introduction to Homological Algebra and Derived Functors

- **Speaker:** Sankha Subhra Chakraborty (B. Math, 3rd year)
- **Abstract:** When a left or right exact functor is applied to a short exact sequence, exactness is only preserved at one end. Derived functors provide a systematic method to continue this sequence on the other end. Most of the talk will include introducing and explaining the setup for talking about these derived functors, including exactness, chain complexes, chain homotopy, and resolutions.
- **Pre-requisites:** Knowledge of elementary linear algebra concepts such as linear maps, kernel, image etc will be helpful for following the talk.

## EP2405: Chaotic Dynamics on the Riemann Sphere

- **Speaker:** Saptarshi Halder (M. Math, 1st year)
- **Abstract:** We give an elementary introduction to the holomorphic dynamics on the Riemann Sphere. We outline some basic concepts regarding this. Next we introduce the notion of Fatou and Julia sets. We see some easy examples. If time permits we will introduce the Mandelbrot set.
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic Real and Complex analysis, Set theory.

- **Date and Time:** Tuesday, 2nd April 2024, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- **Venue:** 2nd Floor Auditorium, Academic Building

## EP2404: Bernstein's problem for minimal surfaces in \\(\mathbb{R}^3\\)

- **Speaker:** Devansh Kamra (B. Math, 2024)
- **Abstract:** Bernstein's problem poses the question that if the graph of a scalar function on \\(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\) is a minimal surface, then whether the function is linear or not. This result holds if and only if \\(n \leq 8\\). We will solve the problem for \\(n = 3\\) after introducing the notion of minimal surfaces and comparing various equivalent definitions, along with developing a necessary condition for the graph of a scalar function to be a minimal surface.

## EP2403: Exact Sequences of Modules and Lazardâ€™s Theorem

- **Speaker:** Sankha Subhra Chakraborty (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** This talk will serve as an introduction to the theory of exact sequences of modules. We will look at Hom and tensor, and discuss their exactness as functors to motivate the need for defining projective and flat modules. We will look at some characterisations of projective modules and discuss the hierarchy of free, projective and flat modules. We will introduce and discuss direct limits of directed systems of modules, and we shall conclude the talk with a theorem of Lazard, namely, the characterisation of flat modules as direct limit of finitely generated free modules.

## EP2402: Introduction to Non-Commutative Spaces

- **Speaker:** Saqib Mushtaq Shah (M. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** We will first demonstrate that commutative (unital) \\(C^\*\\)-algebras are dual to compact Hausdorff spaces through the Gelfand representation. Drawing inspiration from the commutative case, we attempt to construct duals (referred to as noncommutative spaces) of noncommutative \\(C^\*\\)-algebras using various methods of generalization. We prove some basic properties and will establish the relationship between these noncommutative spaces.

## EP2401: A Gist of Optimal Transport

- **Speaker:** Malav Dhaval Doshi (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** In this talk we will explore the roots of optimal transport. Initiating with Monge formation we will delve into the more generalized formation of the optimal transport problem given by Kantorivich. We would then look into the dual formation of the both and an introduction to Legendre Transforms. The core focus of this talk would be to prove the result that rather than optimizing the dual on every pair of functions it suffices to optimize it over the convex pairs of the function. Though it assumes very few things but still it is a cornerstone result of the topic!!
