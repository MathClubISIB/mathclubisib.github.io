## EP2403: Exact Sequences of Modules and Lazardâ€™s Theorem

- **Speaker:** Sankha Subhra Chakraborty (B.Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** This talk will serve as an introduction to the theory of exact sequences of modules. We will look at Hom and tensor, and discuss their exactness as functors to motivate the need for defining projective and flat modules. We will look at some characterisations of projective modules and discuss the hierarchy of free, projective and flat modules. We will introduce and discuss direct limits of directed systems of modules, and we shall conclude the talk with a theorem of Lazard, namely, the characterisation of flat modules as direct limit of finitely generated free modules.

## EP2402: Introduction to Non-Commutative Spaces

- **Speaker:** Saqib Mushtaq Shah (M. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** We will first demonstrate that commutative (unital) \\(C^\*\\)-algebras are dual to compact Hausdorff spaces through the Gelfand representation. Drawing inspiration from the commutative case, we attempt to construct duals (referred to as noncommutative spaces) of noncommutative \\(C^\*\\)-algebras using various methods of generalization. We prove some basic properties and will establish the relationship between these noncommutative spaces.

## EP2401: A Gist of Optimal Transport

- **Speaker:** Malav Dhaval Doshi (B. Math, 2025)
- **Abstract:** In this talk we will explore the roots of optimal transport. Initiating with Monge formation we will delve into the more generalized formation of the optimal transport problem given by Kantorivich. We would then look into the dual formation of the both and an introduction to Legendre Transforms. The core focus of this talk would be to prove the result that rather than optimizing the dual on every pair of functions it suffices to optimize it over the convex pairs of the function. Though it assumes very few things but still it is a cornerstone result of the topic!!
