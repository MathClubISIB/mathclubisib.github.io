## EP2202: A Tour of Markov Chains

- **Speaker:** Sanchayan Bhowal (B. Math, 2023)
- **Abstract:** Do the events of today determine the future or does the past matter? This is the basic philosophy of Markov chains. In this lecture, we will discuss the basic characteristics of Markov chains. Most of the part of the lecture will include different models. I wish to discuss random walks in different structures. Finally, I will describe a special sampling technique called Glauber Dynamics which will be further used in models like random coloring and Ising Model. Do not feel intimidated by the terms if these are all new for you, I will just assume the pre-requisite of Probability I. If time permits, I will discuss mixing times which is one of the most important parts of modern Markov chain theory.

## EP2201: Markov Chains and Stochastic Processes: The introduction you wish you had

- **Speaker:** Sarvesh Ravichandran Iyer (SRF)
- **Abstract:** Stochastic processes and Markov chains are some of the most ubiquitous and indispensable cogs in our world's wheels. In this talk, the study of stochastic processes will be motivated and a gently explosive introduction will be provided. A natural transition to Markov chains will be made, followed by a slew of applications, results, generalizations and links with many other parts of mathematics. A section will be dedicated to some comical applications.

- **Date and Time:** Saturday, 2nd April 2022, 2:00 PM - 3:45 PM
